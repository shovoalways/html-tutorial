## 🙋‍♀️  What is HTML?
- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
- HTML is not considered a programming language 
- HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
- HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
- It's easy to learn


## ⏳ Prerequisite
- 👉 Basic Computing skills
- The first thing you should learn about HTML documents is the structure of web pages and how web pages are created. This will give you a clear indication of how a web page comes together. This is an insight you'll need to have for every website you build.



## 🎯 What to do with HTML?
 - **Web development**. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files. 
 - **Internet navigation**. Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks. 
 - **Web documentation**. HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.
